    My old friend, these poems that you preach
    They're being wasted as you speak
    Remind me once more how they came to be your calling
    Do you even know you're falling?

    You know that for you I'd give an arm
    I'm one of few that never meant you harm
    And I heed you like I heed fire and thunder
    But from time to time I wander  
    And lately I did wonder

    If you did it all to make you feel desired
    Did it all to make you feel admired
    For love to replace your shame

    That's quite the group that you have gathered now
    Most of them, they just want you somehow
    They would pay any price to kiss your skin
    Don't tell me that is loving
    You know that don't mean nothing
    You know

    You must know
    And yet you give it all to make you feel desired
    Give it all to make you feel admired
    For love to replace your shame

    You give it all to make you feel desired
    Give it all to make you feel admired
    For love to replace your shame
    For love to replace your shame
    For us to praise your name

    Now, my friend, I won't forget
    The darkness blinding me before we met
    It's all I need to remember you
    As the light you were
    Even though for sure
    You won't remember me
    No, you won't remember me

    I'm afraid that no amount of fame
    Will ever wash away the shame
    Of knowing not how to love your only friend
    Who will love you 'til the end
    </pre>
